# recbb

Backs up raw Android partitions over adb while in TWRP/OFOX.
Can optionally compress output with xz.
I made this script because my Mi 9T Pro has a lot of data and I can't backup anything in OFOX recovery because it's too large and the Mi 9T Pro doesn't have any MicroSD card slot.

**There's still no restore script.**
